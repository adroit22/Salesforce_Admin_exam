<li><span style="color: #1e1e1e;font-family: 'Salesforce Sans';background-color: #f5f5f5">To make account teams faster to use, you can set up your own personal Default Account Team in your personal settings. Default Teams are a shortcut that saves you from having to enter the same members into the same form over and over again. If the same people usually work together, create a default account team and assign them to it.</span></li>

<li><span style="color: #1e1e1e;font-family: 'Salesforce Sans';background-color: #f5f5f5">If your Salesforce admin has enabled team selling, adding an opportunity team helps team members work together and track the opportunity’s progress.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #1e1e1e;font-family: 'Salesforce Sans';background-color: #f5f5f5">Opportunity teams are a bit like account teams. Both let you relate particular people at your company to accounts or opportunities. But, whereas account team members can be expected to form a long-term relationship with a customer, an opportunity team is a temporary group. It’s composed of people who can help you close a deal. Opportunity team members have special visibility into an opportunity, such as related Chatter posts.</span></li>

What split type do you use to assign credit for the solution engineer? - A revenue split of 100% to you and an overlay split of 50% to  solu.manager</span></li>
